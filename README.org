  Please complete this exercise within 2 days of receipt of this task. To share your solution, send us a link to a repository on the platform of your
  choice (GitHub, or GitLab, or Bitbucket, or something else). Please do not feel that you have to spend the whole time on the exercise, we have
  allowed a longer time to allow you to think on the method. There is no right or wrong answer to this, we are interested in seeing your approach to
  the task.

** Step 1

   A company allows their users to upload pictures to an S3 bucket. These pictures are always in the .jpg format. The company wants these files to be
   stripped from any exif metadata before being shown on their website. Pictures are uploaded to an S3 bucket A.

   Create a system that retrieves .jpg files when they are uploaded to the S3 bucket A, removes any exif metadata, and save them to another S3 bucket
   B. The path of the files should be the same in buckets A and B

   To extend this further, we have two users User A and User B. Create IAM users with the following access:

   - User A can Read/Write to Bucket A
   - User B can Read from Bucket B
